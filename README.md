# Homekit-lock


General smart locks need to be installed by disassembling the original lock and cutting door panels. And a lock that supports homekit or zigbee costs $250.
In order to save the cost of use and improve the quality of lifeï¼ŒI decided to develop a door lock based on WiFi and Homekit protocol.
